Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm using Pyamaze.
This project implements Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the 
shortest path in a randomly generated maze using the pyamaze library.
The program generates a 20x20 maze filled with various obstacles and 
calculates the optimal route from the start position to the goal position
while considering movement costs.
The path is then visualized using agents of different colors.
